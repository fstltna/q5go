C[Terminology

This is a beginner tutorial that explains some of the terminology that occurs in the game of Go. The game is also known as <font>Baduk</font> in Korea, or <font>Weiqi</font> in China.

Most of the western literature uses Japanese terms, and so does this tutorial unless otherwise noted.]
;
C[Terminology

For these examples, we use a 7x7 board - there are 49 playable intersections on it.
Certain points are marked on the board, these are called <font>star-points</font>, or <font>hoshi</font>. They have no special function.]

C[Terminology

The lines are named by distance from the edge - first line, second line, etc.  We say that stones are <font>higher</font> and <font>lower</font>, with lower stones being closer to the edge.
]MN[1]
;AB[cc][ef][eg]TR[bc][cb][cd][dc][df][dg][ee][ff][fg]
C[Terminology

Empty intersections next to a string of stones are called <font>liberties</font>.
]
;AW[cb][cd][dc][df][ee][ff][fg]TR[bc][dg]
C[Terminology

When a group is down to its last liberty, it is said to be in <font>atari</font>. Here, White has given atari to both groups of black stones.]MN[2]
;AW[cc][dd][ec][fe]AB[bb][bc][bd][ca][cd][ce][de][eb][fc]AE[dc][df][ef][eg][ff][fg]
C[Terminology

Certain situations where a group has too few liberties are called a <font>shortage</font> <font>of</font> <font>liberties</font>, or <font>damezumari</font>.

;W[]TR[db]
C[Terminology

Here, Black can capture two stones by playing on the triangled point, because connecting would not gain any liberties for White.]
;AW[da][db][fb]AB[cb][dc][fa]AE[bb][bc][bd][cc][cd][ce][dd][de][ee][fc][fe]TR[ea]
C[Terminology

This is a special case of a shortage of liberties, known as a <font>snap-back</font>. If White captures at the triangled point, Black just recaptures three white stones immediately.]
;AW[dc][ed]AB[dd]AE[ca][cb][da][db][eb][ec][fa][fb]TR[dc]
C[Terminology

A move like the triangled play, bending around a stone, is called by its Japanese term, a <font>hane</font>.]
;AW[ee]AB[de]TR[dc]
C[Terminology

It would still be called a hane in this position, but more specifically this is known as the hane at the head of two stones - often a powerful tactic.]
;AW[cb]AB[cc]LB[cb:2][cc:1]
C[Terminology

If we follow the position for two more moves, we see an example of a <font>double</font> <font>hane</font> played by White. This is also frequently powerful.
]
;AB[ec]AE[cb][cc][de][ee]CR[ec]
C[Terminology

Going back to the basic hane example, here Black has played a <font>cut</font>, leading to this <font>cross-cut</font> pattern.]
;AW[de]AB[cd][ce][df][ee]AE[dc][dd][ec][ed]
C[Terminology

This is the basic pattern for a <font>ladder</font>, something we see in several of the other tutorials.

The Japanese term, which is used very infrequently, is <font>shicho</font>.]MN[9]
;AW[dd][ec][ed][fb][fc]AB[dc][eb][fd][gc]LB[dc:2][dd:1][eb:6][ec:5][ed:3][fb:9][fc:7][fd:4][gc:8]
C[Terminology

Playing out the ladder reveals the reason for the name, a stair-step pattern that ends with White being captured.]
;AB[cc][ec][ef]AE[dc][eb][ed][ee][fb][fc][fd][gc]TR[ec]
C[Terminology

A <font>net</font> (sometimes called <font>geta</font>) is another method of capturing stones. The marked black stone cuts off escape for the two white stones.]
;AB[dc][de][ed][ee]AE[dd][df][ef]TR[dd]
C[Terminology

Empty space surrounded entirely by one stones of one color is called an <font>eye</font>.
This is a basic example, but there are other types of eye.]
;AE[cc]TR[dd]
C[Terminology

For example, this is still an eye - the empty space is surrounded on all sides by the same string of black stones.
]
;AW[bd][be][bf][cb][cc][cf][db][df][eb][ee][fc][fd][fe]TR[dd]
C[Terminology

In this case, we have what is known as a <font>false</font> <font>eye</font>, where there is a defect that allows the opponent to capture parts of the stones surrounding the empty intersection.]
;AE[bd][be][bf][cb][cd][db][dc][eb]TR[cc]
C[Terminology

Removing some stones from the previous example, we arrive at something that occurs in real games. The marked white play is called the <font>eye-stealing</font> <font>tesuji</font>.

A tesuji is a tactically astute move.]
;AW[ac][bc][dc][dd][de][dg][ec][ed][fa][fb][gd][ge]AB[ab][bb][cb][db][ea][eb][ee][ef][eg][fe][fg][gf]AE[ce][cf]TR[ba][ca]
C[Terminology

A group that has (or can make) two eyes is called <font>alive</font>. The upper black group here can subdivide its area at either of the marked two points. The lower group already has two eyes and White is not allowed to play in either of them.]
;AW[ba]AE[dd][de][df][dg][ed][ee][ef][eg][fd][fe][fg][gd][ge][gf]TR[ba]
C[Terminology

Let's say White plays at the marked point. This threatens to <font>kill</font> the black group in the next move.]
;B[ca]
C[Terminology

Black probably should respond and make two eyes for the group. A move that requires a local response is called a <font>sente</font> move.

A move that does not require a response is called <font>gote</font>.]
;AB[ce]AE[ab][ac][ba][bb][bc][ca][cb][cc][db][dc][ea][eb][ec][fa][fb][fc]
C[Terminology

The word <font>extend</font> is used for two different purposes.
]
;B[fe]
C[Terminology

You can make an extension along the side, with varying distance. This one is also called a <font>two-space</font> <font>jump</font>.]
;AB[cf]AE[fe]CR[cf]
C[Terminology

Adding a stone to an existing stone is also called an extension. Since this one goes towards the edge of the board, it might also be termed a <font>descent</font>.]
;AB[dd]AE[ce][cf]
C[Terminology

As an example, let's go through a sequence of moves and give them names.
