C[Basic Tactics
Welcome to this tutorial on basic tactics.
We'll show a few elementary situations that are common, and a useful starting point for beginners to learn.
]
;B[cf]TR[df]
C[Basic Tactics
A stone on the second line is vulnerable to capture.
]
;W[]TR[df]LB[aa:1][ab:1][ac:1][ad:1][ae:1][ba:1][bb:2][bc:2][bd:2][ca:1][cb:2][cc:3][da:1][db:2][ea:1]
C[Basic Tactics
A quick note on terminology: when we say "second line", we count from the edge of the board.
Hence, the marked white stone is on the second line.
]
;W[dg]
C[Basic Tactics
White could try to evade capture by extending. This increases the liberties to two.
]
;B[cg]
C[Basic Tactics
Black reduces the liberties again. White now has a problem.
]
;W[eg]
C[Basic Tactics
Extending again does not increase the number of liberties.
]
;B[fg]
C[Basic Tactics
The white stones are captured.
There are fewer liberties available at the edge of the board. An attacker can make use of this fact.
]
;AW[ce][ef][ff]AB[bd][be]AE[cg][de][ee][fg]TR[ce]
C[Basic Tactics
Another elementary tactic is the <font>ladder</font>. Black to play and capture the marked stone.
]
;B[de]
C[Basic Tactics
White has only one liberty. There's only one way to attempt to evade capture.]
;W[cd]
C[Basic Tactics
Extending gives White two liberties.]
;B[cc]
C[Basic Tactics
Black continues attacking, and we'll have White try to evade capture.]
;W[dd]
C[Basic Tactics
Black continues attacking, and we'll have White try to evade capture.]
;B[ed]
C[Basic Tactics
Black continues attacking, and we'll have White try to evade capture.]
;W[dc]
C[Basic Tactics
Black continues attacking, and we'll have White try to evade capture.
At this point, it should become clear why we call this a ladder - a stairstep pattern emerges.]
;B[db]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder inevitably moves towards the edge of the board.]
;W[ec]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder inevitably moves towards the edge of the board.]
;B[fc]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder inevitably moves towards the edge of the board.]
;W[eb]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder inevitably moves towards the edge of the board.]
;B[fb]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder inevitably moves towards the edge of the board.
This should be familiar: it is the same situation as in our first example.]
;W[ea]
C[Basic Tactics
White is driven towards the edge of the board where there are not enough liberties available.]
;B[fa]
C[Basic Tactics
White is driven towards the edge of the board where there are not enough liberties available.]
;W[da]
C[Basic Tactics
White is driven towards the edge of the board where there are not enough liberties available.]
;B[ca]
C[Basic Tactics
The ladder was a success for Black. Of course, White should not have played it out.
]
;AW[ce]AE[ca][cc][db][ed][fa][fb][fc]TR[ce]
C[Basic Tactics
In this situation, White needs to realize that trying to save the marked stone is futile.
]
;W[ec]
C[Basic Tactics
But there are options for White. The ladder goes through a large part of the board, and a white stone in its path would affect it.
This play is a <font>ladder</font> <font>breaker</font>.]
;B[cd]
C[Basic Tactics
Black can react to the ladder breaker by simply capturing.]
;AW[ce]AE[cd]TR[ce]
C[Basic Tactics
But if Black does nothing, White can now run out with the marked stone.]
;W[cd]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's play out the ladder now.]
;B[cc]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's play out the ladder now.]
;W[dd]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's play out the ladder now.]
;B[ed]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's play out the ladder now.]
;W[dc]
C[Basic Tactics
White connects with the ladder breaker. The white group now has three liberties, which was never the case previously.]
;B[fc]
C[Basic Tactics
Black could try to continue attacking, but since White still has two liberties, there is time to counterattack.]
;W[df]
C[Basic Tactics
Like so. Now it is a black stone that is in atari and will be captured.
]
;AW[ba][ca][cb][db][dg][eb][ed][ee]AB[aa][ab][bb][bc][cg][dc][dd]AE[bd][cd][ce][ef][fc][ff]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's move on to another example.
This looks like a finished game where both sides have peacefully surrounded territory.
But White has a weakness.
]
;B[ef]
C[Basic Tactics
Black can play here, and once again we see a variation of the "capture on the second line" shape.
]
;W[ff]
C[Basic Tactics
The best White can do is to give counter atari to limit the damage.
]
;B[eg]
C[Basic Tactics
Black might capture and be happy, but as we will see shortly this is not the best move.
]
;W[fg]
C[Basic Tactics
White would continue here and both sides have fourteen points.
]
;AW[df][dg]AE[eg][fg]
C[Basic Tactics
In this position, Black has a better move than capturing directly.]
;B[fg]
C[Basic Tactics
Black plays here, and at first glance it seems like this gives White the chance to capture one stone.
]
;W[eg]
C[Basic Tactics
But in the resulting shape, White's three stones only have one liberty.]
;B[ef]
C[Basic Tactics
Black recaptures.]
;AW[df][dg]
C[Basic Tactics
Let's go back and play out the game the way it should end with best play.]
;W[gf]
C[Basic Tactics
White seals off the side territory.]
;B[eg]
C[Basic Tactics
Black must capture eventually.]
;W[fe]TR[gg]
C[Basic Tactics
White must protect here, as otherwise the same kind of weakness will occur again after Black fills the marked liberty.
Now Black has fourteen points to White's eleven.]
;AW[bb][bc][bd][be][bf][cf][df][ef][eg]AB[cd][ce][da][db][eb][ec][fc][fd][fe][ff]AE[aa][ab][ba][cg][dc][dd][gf]TR[cc][cd][ce][de]
C[Basic Tactics
A similar technique can often be applied to capture stones.
Here, the marked black stones have two liberties. How can White capture them?
]
;W[dd]
C[Basic Tactics
White could push in like this, but that is a poor move. Nothing interesting happens.
]
;B[dc]
C[Basic Tactics
Black just connects everything.
]
;AE[dc][dd]
C[Basic Tactics
That leaves the other liberty to try.]
;W[dc]
C[Basic Tactics
White plays a stone which Black can capture immediately. This is called a <font>throw-in</font>.
]
;B[dd]
C[Basic Tactics
If Black does capture, it leads to the same kind of situation we saw before.
The black stones only have one liberty.]
;W[dc]
C[Basic Tactics
White captures.
This kind of pattern, with a capture and a recapture, is called a <font>snapback</font>.]
;AW[cd][de]AB[cc][dd][ee]AE[bb][bd][be][bf][ca][cb][cf][da][db][dc][df][eb][ec][ed][ef][eg][fc][fd][fe][ff][fg]
C[Basic Tactics
Sometimes, players leave a lot of cutting points in their positions.
]
;B[ce]TR[cd][de]
C[Basic Tactics
By playing here, Black makes two threats and can capture either of the marked white stones on the next move.
This tactic is called a <font>double</font> <font>atari</font> and can be devastating.
]
;W[df]
C[Basic Tactics
White might try to rescue one stone.]
;B[bd]
C[Basic Tactics
White might try to rescue one stone.
Black captures the other and has a large advantage.])
