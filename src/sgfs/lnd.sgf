C[Life & Death
This is the second tutorial. It assumes you are familiar with the basic rules.

Here, we will begin to see some of the complexities that can arise from the simple rules.
]
;B[]LB[aa:1][ag:6][ba:2][bg:7][cg:8][dg:9][ga:3][gb:4][gc:5]
C[Life & Death
How much territory does Black have?
There are three groups, and they surround nine intersections.]
;W[]
C[Life & Death
But some of the black groups also have few liberties, so maybe they can be captured?
]
;W[aa]
C[Life & Death
White takes away a liberty from one of the black groups. With the next move, the four black stones can be captured.
]
;B[ba]
C[Life & Death
Black could try to take away the white stone, but now the five black stones only have one liberty.]
;W[aa]
C[Life & Death
Black could try to take away the white stone, but now the five black stones only have one liberty.
So, White can capture them.]
;AB[ab][bb][ca][cb]AE[aa]
C[Life & Death
Back to the original position. What about the other black groups?
]
;W[bg]
C[Life & Death
There are four possible initial moves against the lower side group, but they all lead to similar results. We show only this one. White attacks and takes away a liberty.
]
;B[cg]
C[Life & Death
Black answers, and now White has a problem.]
;W[]LB[ag:A][dg:B]
C[Life & Death
Black's stones only have two liberites, but White needs to fill them both to capture.
]
;B[]LB[ag:A][dg:B]
C[Life & Death
But neither A nor B are valid moves, since a white stone there would not have any liberties.
The black stones are safe from capture, and we say they are <font>alive</font>.
]
;AE[bg][cg]
C[Life & Death
So, what about the final black group?
]
;W[gb]
C[Life & Death
If White attacks, there is nothing Black can do.
]
;B[gc]
C[Life & Death
Answering here only reduces Black's liberties by one, so it does not help.]
;AE[gc]
C[Life & Death
So, White is free to fill in the remaining liberties.]
;W[ga]
C[Life & Death
So, White is free to fill in the remaining liberties.
Like this.
]
;B[gc]
C[Life & Death
Black can capture, but now the situation is the same as in the upper left. Black is dead.
]
;AE[gc]
C[Life & Death
But if Black were to play first, there is a difference between the top left and the top right.
]
;B[gb]
C[Life & Death
By playing on the <font>vital</font> <font>point</font>, the black group becomes alive.
Once more there are two moves White would have to make, and neither is allowed.]
;W[]LB[ga:A][gc:B]
C[Life & Death
We call these surrounded points <font>eyes</font>. Normally, a group needs to be able to make at least two eyes to live. (We'll see exceptions later.)
]
;AE[gb]
C[Life & Death
Back to the original position. We have seen one example each of a <font>dead</font> group, an <font>alive</font> group, and an <font>unsettled</font> group where it depends on whose turn it is whether it lives or dies.
]
;AW[ad][bd][cd][dd][df][dg][fa][fb][fc][gc]AB[ac][ae][bc][be][ce][cg][ee][fe]AE[ab][af][bf][ea][eb][ff][fg][ge]
C[Life & Death
Here are some of the basic shapes that can occur in life and death situations.
There are two unsettled black groups, and a dead one.
]
;W[aa]
C[Life & Death
The top left is very similar to the unsettled group we saw in the first position.
Either player can make a move in the center to either make or prevent two eyes.
]
;B[gf]
C[Life & Death
In the bottom right, there is also a vital point. If Black plays there, the group has two eyes.
]
;W[fg]
C[Life & Death
White might try to attack, but it is futile.
]
;B[ff]
C[Life & Death
Black has two eyes.
]
;AW[gf]AE[ff][fg]
C[Life & Death
If White plays on the vital point, the five-point space can no longer be divided into two eyes.
(There is more to say about this shape, but we'll ignore the details for now.)]
;W[]
C[Life & Death
This leaves the bottom left to consider, and this is a little different: Black is just dead.
]
;B[af]
C[Life & Death
Any move Black might try to make just leads to the same shape as in the top left.
]
;W[bg]
C[Life & Death
White plays on the vital point to kill.
You might like to verify that if White plays first, the black group can eventually be put into atari and captured.]
;AW[ac][ae][af][bb][bc][ca][cb][cg][ea][ee][fd]AB[bd][bf][cc][cd][db][dd][de][eb][ec]AE[aa][ce][dc][ef][eg][fa][fe][gc][gd][gf]TR[dc]
C[Life & Death
Not everything that looks like an eye actually is one.
Beware <font>false</font> <font>eyes</font>, which occur when the tail of a group can be captured.
]
;W[dc]
C[Life & Death
White could play here. Because of the capture, the white stone has liberties, so this is a valid move.
Now the remaining black stones are in atari.]
;AB[db][eb][ec]AE[dc]
C[Life & Death
Going back, Black is just dead in this position.]
;AE[cb]TR[cb]
C[Life & Death
If we remove one of the white stones, the black group is unsettled. Black could connect at the triangled point to make two eyes.
]
;AE[ed]
C[Life & Death
If we remove yet another white stone, the black group is alive: there are now two options for connection.
]
;W[cb]
C[Life & Death
If White takes away one possibility...]
;B[ed]
C[Life & Death
If White takes away one possibility, Black just takes the other.

Black now has two secure eyes.]
;AE[cb][ed]LB[cb:A][ed:B]
C[Life & Death
This is a fundamental concept in Go: having two equivalent options. Such a situation is known as <font>miai</font>.]
;AW[ag][be][ce][db][dc][dd][de][ef][ff][fg][gf]AB[bg][df][dg][ea][ed][ee][fe][ge]AE[ac][ad][bb][bc][bd][ca][cc][cd][cg][fb][fc][fd]
C[Life & Death
Here is a new example position. What is going on here on the lower side?
]
;W[eg]
C[Life & Death
Black has two liberties, so White might try to take away one of them.
(The other liberty is an eye, so it can't be taken in the original board position.)]
;B[gg]
C[Life & Death
Black has two liberties, so White might try to take away one of them.
But that doesn't end well.
]
;AW[ef][ff][fg][gf]AE[gg]TR[eg]
C[Life & Death
The same would happen if Black were to try to attack.
Neither side can play on the triangled point without losing everything.
]
;W[]
C[Life & Death
Here, neither group has two eyes, but despite this they cannot be captured. This kind of situation is known as <font>seki</font>.
]
;AW[ac][ba][bc][bd][bf][bg][cc][ee][eg]AB[cd][ce][cg][dc][fd][ff][fg][gd]AE[ae][af][ag][df][dg][ge][gf]
C[Life & Death
In the previous position, both sides had an eye. A seki can also occur without eyes.]
;B[]TR[df][dg]
C[Life & Death
Neither side wants to play on either of the triangled points, because that would put their own stones in atari.
]
;W[]LB[cd:A][dd:B]
C[Life & Death
Therefore, the two strings of stones marked A and B are both alive in seki.]
;AW[af][ag][dc][df][dg][fa][fb][fc][fd][fg][ga][gb][gc][gd][gg]AB[ad][bd][ee][ef][gf]AE[be][fe]
C[Life & Death
Sometimes you do not mind having your stones captured.
It might look like both black groups are alive in seki, but in fact one of them is dead.
]
;W[ae]
C[Life & Death
If White plays here, there is only one shared liberty for the black and the white stones in the lower left.
]
;B[be]
C[Life & Death
Black can capture the white stones.
But do you recognize the resulting shape?]
;W[af]
C[Life & Death
It is in fact one of the unsettled shapes we saw earlier: the <font>bulky</font> <font>five</font>. White can kill by playing on the vital point.
]
;W[ge]
C[Life & Death
On the other side of the board, the situation is different.
This white move is bad, since it allows a large capture.
]
;B[fe]
C[Life & Death
Black's group is large enough that it can make two eyes no matter what White tries.
White should have left the position alone. It would have remained as seki.
]
;AW[ae][ag][bf][ca][ec][fa][fb][fc][ff][gc][gf]AB[ab][bb][bg][cb][db][eg][fd][gd]AE[be][ed]LB[af:2][ca:1][gf:3]
C[Life & Death
Here are a few more examples. The numbered groups are all in atari, but capturing them does not help Black, since doing so leaves behind a killable shape.
]
;B[aa]
C[Life & Death
Let's just play it out to see White's best response if Black captures everywhere.]
;W[ca]
C[Life & Death
Let's just play it out to see White's best response if Black captures everywhere.]
;B[be]
C[Life & Death
Let's just play it out to see White's best response if Black captures everywhere.]
;W[af]
C[Life & Death
Let's just play it out to see White's best response if Black captures everywhere.]
;B[ge]
C[Life & Death
White does not even need to respond to this final capture. As we saw earlier, the <font>square-four</font> shape is dead as it stands.
What about the central white stones though? They only have one eye.
]
;B[ed]
C[Life & Death
Black could try to attack the white stones by taking away their liberties.
]
;W[da]
C[Life & Death
Black could try to attack the white stones by taking away their liberties.
However, White is quicker.
]
;B[gb]TR[ac][bc][cc][dc][dd][de][df][dg][ec][fa][fb][fc][gc]SQ[aa][ab][bb][cb][db][ea][eb]
C[Life & Death
Now, both the black and the white stones are in atari, but it is White's turn.

]
;W[ba]
C[Life & Death
White wins. Such a situation, where groups that are not independently alive try to capture each other, is called a <font>capturing</font> <font>race</font>.
There are more examples in the "Captures" tutorial.])
