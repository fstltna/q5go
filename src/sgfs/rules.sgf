C[Rules of Go

This is an introduction to the rules of Go. Use the cursor keys or the buttons to navigate.

;B[cc]LB[cc:1]
C[Rules of Go
The players take turns placing stones on intersections.

Black goes first.

Black goes first.

Once placed, a stone never moves, but it can be captured.

;AE[cc][ee][gc]
C[Rules of Go
Usually, some intersections on the board are marked with thicker dots.
These are called star points, but they are for visual reference only. They have no special properties.]
;AW[ee]AB[cc][gc]TR[bc][cb][cd][dc][de][ed][ef][fc][fe][gb][gd]
C[Rules of Go
Intersections are connected by lines on the board.
Empty spaces next to a stone are called <font>liberties</font>.
]
;AW[cb][cd][dc]AE[ee][gc]TR[bc]
C[Rules of Go
Stones need liberties to remain on the board.

A stone with only one remaining liberty is said to be in <font>atari</font>.
]
;W[bc]
C[Rules of Go
Stones need liberties to remain on the board.

Once the opponent removes the last liberty, the stone is captured.
]
;AW[bg][cf]AB[cg]AE[bc][cb][cd][dc]TR[dg]
C[Rules of Go
There are fewer liberties at the edge (or in the corners) of the board.

]MN[7]
;W[dg]
C[Rules of Go
There are fewer liberties at the edge (or in the corners) of the board.
Thus, fewer moves are necessary to capture a stone on the edge.
]
;AW[be][cd][df][ee]AB[ce][de]AE[bg][dg]TR[dd]
C[Rules of Go
Stones of the same colour are also connected by the lines.

Connected stones form a unit that can only be captured as a whole, when all liberties are filled.

Stones of the same colour are also connected by the lines.

Connected stones form a unit that can only be captured as a whole, when all liberties are filled.

;AB[bd][ce][de]AE[dd]TR[dd]
C[Rules of Go
Stones of the same colour are also connected by the lines.

Diagonals do not form a connection.

Stones of the same colour are also connected by the lines.

Diagonals do not form a connection.

Different units can be captured separately.

C[Rules of Go
As a beginner, you may find it difficult to visualize connections. This program offers a feature to help with that.

Try toggling the "visualization aid" checkbox.
]
;B[]
C[Rules of Go
Try not to become reliant on having the program visualize the connections. It is unavailable on real boards or in match conditions.

C[Example

What if the black stones try to escape capture?

After this move, they have two liberties, one more than before.]

What if the black stones try to escape capture?

White reduces the number of liberties to one again.

Although this is a disaster for Black, remember that in other situations stones are able to escape.

We'll see more examples later.

C[Rules of Go
Is White allowed to play at the triangled point?

There are no empty spaces next to it, so - would the white stone have liberties?
]
;W[dd]
C[Rules of Go
Is White allowed to play at the triangled point?

Yes, since by capturing all the black stones, the white stone gains liberties.
]
;AB[cc][cd][ce][dc][de][ec][ed][ee]AE[db][dd]TR[dd]
C[Rules of Go
This situation is different. Playing on the triangled point would not be a capture.
White is not allowed to play there since his stone would not have liberties.
]
;AW[cd][dc][de]AB[dd][fd]AE[bc][bd][be][cb][cc][ce][cf][df][eb][ed][ef][fc][fe]
C[Rules of Go
A funny thing can happen with captures.
]
;W[ed]
C[Rules of Go
If White captures a stone, it looks like Black could just recapture.

That would repeat the board position, and that is not allowed.

This situation is called <font>ko</font>.
]
;B[bb]
C[Rules of Go
To avoid repeating the position, Black needs to play a move elsewhere first.

Often, this will be a large ko threat which White needs to answer. (Here, we just play on random points for illustration.)
]
;W[ba]
C[Rules of Go
If White answers the ko threat, the board position has changed, and Black is allowed to recapture.
]
;B[dd]
C[Rules of Go
If White answers the ko threat, the board position has changed, and Black is allowed to recapture.

Then, White needs to find a threat to continue fighting the ko.

C[Rules of Go
Captures are worth a point at the end of the game.

But surrounding empty intersections to make <font>territory</font> is also worth a point each.

C[Rules of Go
In this game, Black has surrounded 15 points of territory, while White has 16.

White often also gets a bonus, called <font>komi</font>, to compensate for going second.]MN[0]

Scoring a finished game can be difficult for beginners.
This is especially true with the commonly used Japanese ruleset.
The best advice is to not worry too much about it, just play to get experience.]

Players pass when they see no more useful moves, and if both players pass, the game ends and counting begins.

This is the result of scoring the game: dead stones are simply marked as such and removed from the board as prisoners.
But how to identify dead stones? This will be shown in the next tutorial.
