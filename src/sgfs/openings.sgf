C[Openings
Welcome to this beginner-level tutorial on openings.
As a complete novice, you should play on smaller boards like 9x9 for a while to get a basic grasp of the game's tactical possibilities.]
;B[]
C[Openings
Once you are feeling more confident, you might want to tackle the 19x19 board.
This tutorial will cover the basics of playing the opening on a large board. It is by no means exhaustive.]
;AE[cp][dc][oc][pe][pq][qd][qo]LB[jd:2][jj:3][pd:1]
C[Openings
"Corners, then sides, then center" is a general guideline for how to proceed in the opening.
It is easiest to make living groups and territory in the corners, followed by the sides.]
;W[]LB[pc:A][pd:B][qd:A]
C[Openings
The most common opening moves are A and B: the 3-4 point, and the 4-4 point.]
;B[]LB[oc:D][od:E][pc:A][pd:B][qc:C][qd:A]
C[Openings
But C, D and E area also played. All these moves are recognized as good, but you can play whereever you like.
]
;B[qd]
C[Openings
In a normal opening, players take up corner positions first.]
;W[dd]
C[Openings
In a normal opening, players take up corner positions first.]
;B[pq]
C[Openings
In a normal opening, players take up corner positions first.]
;W[dp]
C[Openings
In a normal opening, players take up corner positions first.
Black has chosen two 3-4 points, while White has played two star points.
]
;B[oc]LB[nc:A][nd:B][od:C]
C[Openings
Adding a second stone makes a corner enclosure. It's most common with 3-4 points, like the one Black has played.
Any move at A, B or C would also be recognized as enclosure.
]
;W[qo]LB[po:A]
C[Openings
To prevent a corner enclosure, the opponent could make an <font>approach</font> move such as this.
A play at A would also be a very common approach move.
]
;B[np]
C[Openings
Black might extend towards the other side to reinforce the corner stone.
]
;W[ql]
C[Openings
If White extends in the other direction, this is a peaceful way of playing.
A two-space extension on the third line is generally a fairly stable setup.
]
;B[fq]
C[Openings
One can also play an approach move against the 4-4 star point stone.
]
;W[cn]
C[Openings
This is a similar idea as previously - when approached, extend in the other direction.
]
;B[dr]
C[Openings
Black could play this slide, which threatens to take the corner.
(Full disclosure: strong players no longer play this, but it was considered good for a long time. Don't worry about it.)
]
;W[cq]
C[Openings
A normal choice for White is to protect the corner territory.
]
;B[iq]
C[Openings
And Black extends again, for stability.
The sequence we have just seen is a <font>joseki</font>, which means a series of moves that occur often and are considered reasonable for both sides.]
;AE[cq][iq]
C[Openings
You need to be aware that just because something is joseki, your opponent might not want to play that way.
The peaceful continuation we have seen is not the only possible outcome.]
;W[gq]
C[Openings
A move like this might come as a surprise. We will not go into the variations here, but remember: a lot of things are possible on the Go board. Don't expect your opponent to follow your plans.
]
;AE[cn][dr][fq][gq]
C[Openings
Approach moves are not the only way to play. The 4-4 point in particular has a known weakness.

]
;B[cq]
C[Openings
The 3-3 invasion is a common idea, and it occurs frequently in modern play.
Beginners might want to stay clear of it, since it can become quite difficult.
]
;W[dq]
C[Openings
Generally, White blocks on one side or the other.
]
;B[cp]TR[ap][aq][ar][bp][bq][br]
C[Openings
Black extends, claiming territory and eye space in the marked area.
Many continuations are possible.
]
;W[co]
C[Openings
For many years, this was the primary continuation, and it is still instructive. White presses Black down.

]
;B[bo]
C[Openings
Black continues to surround the corner.
]
;W[cn]
C[Openings
Extending is one possible choice for White.
]
;B[bn]
C[Openings
Black strengthens the corner stone.
]
;W[cm]
C[Openings
There's more to say, but in a beginner tutorial let's stop it here.
We see that there has been a division of spoils, which is a common outcome in corner patterns.
]
;B[]TR[ap][aq][ar][bp][bq][br]
C[Openings
Black can expect to make life and some points in the corner.
]
;W[]SQ[cm][cn][co][dp][dq]
C[Openings
White has a wall facing the side and the center. This does not surround any territory just yet: White has to play to actively use it.
]
;W[jq]
C[Openings
For example, playing an extension from a wall is typical.
The closer an extension is to a wall, the more secure it is, but it may be less efficient.
(Yes, White just played two moves in a row. This is just for illustration.)]
;AW[lq]AE[jq]TR[lq]
C[Openings
White could think about going closer to Black's other corner position. This combines extension with attack, at the expense of safety.
]
;AE[bn][bo][cm][cn][co][cp][cq][dq][lq][np][ql]TR[qo]
C[Openings
Let's go back and show another way of dealing with an approach move.
]
;B[qk]
C[Openings
Black could play a <font>pincer</font>, limiting White's ability to extend along the side for safety.
These days, pincers are played less commonly, but they are still important.
]
;W[no]
C[Openings
If extending along the side is not possible, jumping into the center is another option.
]
;B[mq]
C[Openings
Black would extend on the side to avoid being encircled, and many continuations are possible here - outside the scope of a beginner tutorial.
]
;AB[pd][pp]AE[mq][no][oc][pq][qd][qk][qo]
C[Openings
Let's look at a different type of opening. Here, both players have made their moves on the four star points.
]
;B[pj]
C[Openings
Instead of an approach move, Black could try to set up a position on the right side.
A common idea is to build a large framework, also called a <font>moyo</font>, which could become territory over time.
]
;W[nc]
C[Openings
White could approach to limit the scope of Black's area.
Many responses to this have been seen over the years.
]
;B[lc]
C[Openings
To illustrate they moyo idea, let's have Black play this one-space pincer.
]
;W[qc]
C[Openings
White can dive into the corner. We saw that the 3-3 point is a weakness, and White has an extra stone already to support this invasion.
]
;B[qd]
C[Openings
Black wants to develop the right side and blocks to prevent White from entering it.]
;W[pc]
C[Openings
White connects up, gaining a fair amount of territory.
]
;B[od]TR[oc]
C[Openings
Black extends - this strengthens Blacks's stones, blocks White again, and also threatens to push in at the marked point.
]
;W[nb]
C[Openings
White protects the weak point.
]
;B[me]
C[Openings
Black loosely connects all of the stones in the area. This is another joseki sequence. White has taken the corner.

]
;W[]TR[oe][of][og][oh][oi][pe][pf][pg][ph][pi][qe][qf][qg][qh][qi][re][rf][rg][rh][ri][se][sf][sg][sh][si]
C[Openings
In exchange for the corner, Black lays claim to the side area, where the black stones are now quite strong.
This is not secure territory, but any white stones played there will be outnumbered and under attack.
]
;AW[nq][nr][pq][qq]AB[lq][mo][op][qp]
C[Openings
If the same joseki occurs again in the other corner, Black's moyo starts to look imposing.
This position and similar ones have been played in professional games.
]
;AB[pq]AE[lc][lq][me][mo][nb][nc][nq][nr][od][op][pc][pd][pj][pp][qc][qp][qq]
C[Openings
Let's look at some more possibilities.
]
;B[fc]
C[Openings
Does an approach move need to be answered?
]
;W[qo]
C[Openings
White could just approach Black's corner in return.
]
;B[cf]
C[Openings
This gives Black the option to play a double approach.
As always, you can play whatever you want, but it's rarely a good idea to ignore a double approach.
]
;W[np]
C[Openings
But let's say White chooses to continue attacking in the lower right.
These kinds of double approach positions tend to lead to more complex fights rather than peaceful results.
]
;B[po]
C[Openings
Let's just show one sequence. The moves are not important, and too hard to understand for a beginner. But the end result is worth looking at.]

;B[pl]
C[Openings
This is where we'll stop looking at the moves. Let's see what just happened.
]
;W[]TR[lq][nq][op][oq][pq]SQ[pp][qo][qp][qq][rm]
C[Openings
On the sides, we see a fairly equal division: both sides have made similar-looking shapes which surround side territory. These are solid positions.
]
;B[]TR[pl][pn][po]SQ[no][np][oo]
C[Openings
But there is also one white and black group each in the center. These stones have no eye space, and they surround no territory.
These are <font>weak</font> <font>groups</font>.
]
;W[]TR[pl][pn][po]SQ[no][np][oo]
C[Openings
It is important to recognize weak groups, and it is often best to avoid creating them.
Here, both players have one, and it should be a reasonably even fight. Don't be the only player with weak groups after the opening!
]
;W[fd]
C[Openings
Returning to the upper left corner, we can show another general principle.
When outnumbered, attachments are often good to develop quickly.]
;B[gd]
C[Openings
Black will want to respond, and the fight develops from there.
]
;W[ec]TR[fc]
C[Openings
White might block, trying to surround the corner and threatening one black stone.]
;B[fe]
C[Openings
Black plays a forcing move.
]
;W[ed]
C[Openings
White needs to connect.
]
;B[ge]
C[Openings
Many continuations are possible. Black could connect to defend one of the cutting points.
]
;W[gc]
C[Openings
White captures and gets a secure position.
(Please verify for yourself that the black stone is captured.)]
;AW[cf]AE[ec][ed][fd][fe][gc][gd][ge][lq][no][np][nq][oo][op][oq][pl][pn][po][pp][qo][qp][qq][rm]LB[db:A]
C[Openings
Let's go back to a simpler position.
After approach move and response, we already saw the slide at A as one possible continuation. The idea is to develop a stable position from the approach stone.


]
;B[ic]
C[Openings
A simple extension is also possible.
]
;W[ec]
C[Openings
This gives White the possibility of playing this <font>kick</font>. This surrounds more of the corner for White, and threatens Black's stone.
]
;B[fd]
C[Openings
An extension would be logical: this gains two liberties. Black now has a strong position, but it is a little cramped.
Efficiency is important in the opening (and throughout the game of Go).
]
;AE[cf][ec][fc][fd][ic]
C[Openings
In fact, let's make this point more strongly, by showing the difference between efficient and inefficient play.]
;B[od]
C[Openings
In this opening, White is going to play good moves, while Black will make a series of narrow and inefficient extensions.]
;W[fc]

;B[kc]
C[Openings

;W[ej]
C[Openings
Let's end the example here.
Black has two secure territories, but they will not be able to grow very much.
White has developed on a much larger scale, and even though it is less safe, it is a better position.
