C[Connections
Welcome to this tutorial, where we cover various possibilities of connecting stones.
Why connect? Separated stones must live independently, thus connected stones are often stronger.
]
;AE[ef][fe][gf]
C[Connections
Going back all the way to the rules, this is a group of two connected stones. They are vertically adjacent and thus form a connected unit.
However, there are more interesting forms of connection.]
;AW[ff][gg]AB[gf]
C[Connections
As a contrast, this is the most basic disconnected shape. None of the involved stones can directly connect to their friend.
Interesting things can happen here, but that's a matter for a different tutorial.]
;AE[ff][gg]
C[Connections
These two stones form a <font>diagonal</font> <font>move</font>. In this board position, they cannot be disconnected.

C[Connections
These two stones form a <font>diagonal</font> <font>move</font>. In this board position, they cannot be disconnected.
Black can make a solid connection with A or B.]MN[2]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
White might try to separate, like this.]
;B[gg]
C[Connections
Black just takes the other option. The diagonal move creates a <font>miai</font> situation, where two equivalent options for connection exist.
]
;AE[ff]
C[Connections
If we take away the white stone, what is left is called an <font>empty</font> <font>triangle</font>, a classic <font>bad</font> <font>shape</font>.
]
;W[]TR[gg]
C[Connections
If we take away the white stone, what is left is called an empty triangle, a classic bad shape.
One reason this is bad is that Black has played an unnecessary move, connecting before White threatened to disconnect.
]
;AB[ee]AE[gf][gg]
C[Connections
Once stones are further apart, connections become more tenuous. This particular shape is called a <font>knight's</font> <font>move</font>.
In this board position, Black is still connected.]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
White might try to play in between the two black stones to separate them.]
;B[ef]
C[Connections
Black answers.]
;W[eg]
C[Connections
Now White has successfully played a <font>cut</font>, but there is a problem.]
;B[gf]
C[Connections
One of White's stones can be captured. This is the ladder shape which you should recognize from an earlier tutorial.]
;AW[fe][gd][ge][hc][hd][ia][ib][ic]AB[fd][gc][hb][he][id][ja][jb][jc]
C[Connections
Here's a reminder of how things will turn out. White cannot evade capture.]
;AE[ef][eg][fd][fe][ff][gc][gd][ge][gf][hb][hc][hd][he][ia][ib][ic][id][ja][jb][jc]
C[Connections
However, our connection depends on conditions elsewhere on the board.]
;AW[cg][ci][gc][id]
C[Connections
However, our connection depends on conditions elsewhere on the board.
If White has <font>ladder</font> <font>breakers</font> in place, the knight's move can be cut because the ladders no longer work.]
;AW[dd][de][ed][fd][gd][ge]AB[eg][fe]AE[cg][ci][gc][id]LB[ef:A][ff:B]
C[Connections
Let's show another type of solid connection.
The black shape is called a <font>bamboo</font> <font>joint</font>. Black has miai at A and B to make a solid connection.
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
If White takes one point...
]
;B[ef]
C[Connections
If White takes one point, Black takes the other and is connected.
]
;AE[ef][eg][ff]
C[Connections
In fact, in many situations a bamboo joint is overkill. In this position, Black is also connected.
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
Once again, White might try to separate.]
;B[ef]
C[Connections
There is only one choice for Black's move.
]
;W[]LB[eg:B][gf:A]
C[Connections
Now, Black has miai alternatives: a solid connection at B is nice, but capturing a stone at A would be just as good.
]
;AE[dd][de][ed][ee][ef][fd][ff][gd][ge]
C[Connections
Let's take away even more stones. This shape here is called a <font>one-space</font> <font>jump</font>.
Can white separate it, or is it connected?
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
White will have to play here to attempt to separate.
]
;B[ef]
C[Connections
Black has two responses, but they are symmetrical, so let's just pick this one.]
;W[gf]
C[Connections
White needs to extend to prevent the stone from being captured.
]
;B[ee]
C[Connections
Black connects on one side.
]
;W[eg]
C[Connections
White cuts on the other side.
There is no immediate way to capture any of the white stones. Does this mean the one-space jump can be cut?]
;AW[cd][ch][dd][dh][ee][ge][gg][hd][hh][id][ih]AB[dc][de][dg][di][ec][ed][eh][ei][gc][gd][gh][gi][hc][he][hg][hi]AE[ef][fe][ff][fg][gf]
C[Connections
The problem for White is that Black has many choices to answer. In any given board position, it is likely that one of these outcomes is favourable for Black.
And these are just the symmetries of one position; other options exist.
]
;B[]
C[Connections
In summary, the one-space jump can be cut. In practice, this is rarely a good idea, but you need to be aware of the possibility.
]
;AW[fe][gf]AB[ff][ge]AE[cd][ch][dc][dd][de][dg][dh][di][ec][ed][ee][eg][eh][ei][gc][gd][gg][gh][gi][hc][hd][he][hg][hh][hi][id][ih]
C[Connections
In fact, there is an important lesson here.
Fundamentally, if your stones are cut, so are those of your opponent.
]
;W[]
C[Connections
Even if we talk about connections in this tutorial, it is also true that you don't always need to connect. You just need to get a good result.
]
;AW[ch][hh]AB[ef][ei]AE[fe][ff][ge][gf]
C[Connections
Let's explore this concept with an example. This is a corner position that might occur in a real game.
Black's two-space jump can be cut, but that is not an issue.]
;W[eg]
C[Connections
You do not need to understand all the moves in this example. It's the end result that is interesting.]

C[Connections
You do not need to understand all the moves in this example. It's the end result that is interesting.]
;W[fe]
C[Connections
In the end, Black hasn't connected the two original stones. In fact, one of them is captured.
But there is also one White stone that's separated from the others, so this may be an acceptable result.
]
;B[]
C[Connections
It's important to look for possibilities such as this just as much as one looks for ways to connect.

End of digression.]
;AB[fe]AE[ch][dg][ee][ef][eg][ei][ff][gf][gi][hh]
C[Connections
We've seen this pattern earlier as an example of a connected shape.
However, shapes don't occur in a vacuum. What happens if there are white stones nearby?
]
;AW[ef][eg][fh][gh][hg]
C[Connections
In this more realistic position, the white stones have an effect on Black's connection.]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
White can push in here. Black is in atari and must respond.
]
;B[gf]
C[Connections
Black extends...
]
;W[ge]
C[Connections
White cuts. Not only is Black separated, the three stones are in atari.
]
;B[hf]TR[fe]
C[Connections
Black might continue, but now White can at the very least capture the triangled stone in a ladder.
]
;AE[ff][ge][gf][hf]
C[Connections
Going back, Black needs to add a stone to ensure connection.
]
;B[ge]
C[Connections
Going back, Black needs to add a stone to ensure connection.
Making a bamboo joint is a good option here.
]
;AW[ee][hd][he]AB[fc]
C[Connections
Even something as secure as the bamboo joint can run into trouble.
Let's add a few stones and see what happens in this position.]
;W[gf]
C[Connections
To start with, White can threaten the connection of the bamboo joint.]
;B[ff]
C[Connections
Black can connect. This is not advisable, but let's see what happens.]
;W[fd]
C[Connections
White continues here. This separates the two black groups and reduces Black's liberties to one.
]
;B[gd]
C[Connections
Playing here does not gain a liberty for the black stones.]
;W[gc]
C[Connections
Oops.
]
;AB[fe][ff][fg][ge][gg]AE[gc]
C[Connections
So, back to this position. Black could try to capture one stone.
]
;B[hf]
C[Connections
Like this.
]
;W[gd]
C[Connections
But now, White has not only cleanly separated the black stones, there is another problem: once again there is a <font>shortage</font> <font>of</font> <font>liberties</font>.
]
;B[gf]
C[Connections
Connecting does not help.
]
;W[if]
C[Connections
Oops.
]
;AB[fe][fg][ge][gg]AE[fd][gd][if]LB[fe:B][fg:A]
C[Connections
In summary, Black does not have a secure connection between the two groups A and B, since the white stones are perfectly placed to take away crucial liberties.
]
;AW[ge][hf]AB[dg][gf]AE[ee][ef][eg][fc][fe][gg][hd][he]
C[Connections
Similar problems can occur for other types of connection. Here, the diagonal move does not ensure a connection.
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
If White plays here, Black cannot connect.
]
;B[gg]
C[Connections
If Black does connect, it results in a bigger loss.
]
;W[eg]
C[Connections
White captures.
]
;AB[ef][fe][fg]AE[dg][eg][ff][fh][ge][gh][hf][hg]
C[Connections
We saw that the diagonal move relied on miai alternatives for connection.
What happens if there are several such shapes near each other?
]
;AW[de][df][dg][gf]
C[Connections
We saw that the diagonal move relied on miai alternatives for connection.
What happens if there are several such shapes near each other?
Of course, White would have stones here too.
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
If White pushes in here, Black has a problem.
]
;B[ee]
C[Connections
It does not matter on which side Black connects.
]
;W[eg]
C[Connections
White cuts on the other side.
]
;AE[ee][eg][ff]TR[ff]
C[Connections
The problem here is that both connections rely on the same point as one of their alternatives.
This point becomes overloaded.

]
;AW[he][hf][hg]AE[ef][gf]
C[Connections
The one-space jump also becomes very weak in a similar way when there are strong positions nearby.
]
;W[ff]
C[Connections
Earlier we saw that Black has many ways to answer, but in this position they all produce essentially the same result.]
;B[gf]
C[Connections
This is one possible continuation.]
;W[ef]
C[Connections
This is one possible continuation.]
;B[ge]
C[Connections
This is one possible continuation.]
;W[gg]
C[Connections
And Black is cut.
Of course, this is not surprising, seeing how Black was heavily outnumbered at the start.
]
;AW[eg][fc][fe][fg]AB[df][dg][eh][fh][gh][hf][hg]AE[de][ef][ff][ge][gf][he]
C[Connections
This is a famous position known as the crane's nest, which involves a shortage of liberties.
It may seem like the three white stones are connected to the outside, but Black has other ideas.
]
;B[ff]
C[Connections
The central point is the <font>tesuji</font>, which is the term for a tactically astute move.
Of course, any other move would let White connect immediately.
]
;W[ef]
C[Connections
White has little choice but to give atari to the black stone.
]
;B[ee]
C[Connections
Black does not save the one stone and instead plays a counter-atari.
]
;W[gf]
C[Connections
White must capture.
]
;B[ge]
C[Connections
This is the finishing touch. White is down to one liberty, and connecting doesn't change that fact. White's stones will be captured.
]
;AW[ch][di][ei]AB[fi]AE[df][dg][ee][ef][eg][fc][fe][fg][fh][ge][gf][gg][gh][hf][hg]
C[Connections
Let's look at some other possibilities for connecting stones.
]
;B[fh]
C[Connections
This is a solid connection. The black stones can't be separated, but this move also does not develop very far.
]
;AB[gh]AE[fh]
C[Connections
This is an alternative that is frequently used. It is called the <font>tiger's</font> <font>mouth</font>, and in this situation it extends a little further along the lower side.]
;W[fh]
C[Connections
White can't really do anything to disconnect the black stones. A move like this is futile.
]
;B[fg]
C[Connections
Black just captures.
]
;AE[fg]
C[Connections
White might try to take a more indirect approach.
]
;W[fg]
C[Connections
This kind of move is known as a <font>peep</font>. It only threatens to cut.
]
;B[fh]
C[Connections
Black will likely connect. The question then becomes who gained more from the previous two moves.
]
;AE[fg][gh]
C[Connections
In fact, we can compare the previous result against the solid connection.
]
;AW[fg]AB[gh]TR[gi]SQ[fg][gh]
C[Connections
We've added one stone for either side, and note how Black was forced to make an empty triangle. We saw earlier that this is regarded as bad shape.
This is balanced out by a little more development.
]
;AE[fg][fh]
C[Connections
Questions of positional judgment are rarely easy. Let's just say the tiger's mouth is a frequently used connection.
]
;AW[bi][bj][ci][dh][eh][fh][fi][gi][gj][gk]AB[cj][di][dk][ei][fj][fk]AE[gh]
C[Connections
Let's use the opportunity for a brief digression about bad shape. It is important not to misapply this concept.
]
;B[ej]
C[Connections
Black's move makes two empty triangles. But more importantly, the group now has two eyes and is alive. A white move here would have killed it.
Bad shape is not relevant in life and death situations.
]
;W[]
C[Connections
It is important to avoid bad shape if possible.
But sometimes, it is necessary. And in some situations, you can force the opponent to make equally bad shape, leading to a fair result.

End of digression.

;AW[ei][ej][gg][gh]AB[fe][ff][fg][fh][fi]AE[bi][bj][bk][ch][ci][cj][ck][dh][di][dk][fj][fk][gk]
C[Connections
At the edge of the Go board, sometimes shapes behave differently than they do in the center.
Here we have an example where two white groups are connected.
]
;B[fj]
C[Connections
Black might try to push in between them to separate.
]
;W[fk]
C[Connections
With this move, White secures connection.]
;B[]LB[ek:A][gk:B]
C[Connections
Black's has two cuts available at A and B. But in either case, a black stone played there could be captured immediately.
]
;AW[ee][ef][eg][fh][gd][ge][gf]AB[fc][fd]AE[eh][ei][ej][fi][fj][fk][gh][gi][gj]LB[eh:A][gh:B]
C[Connections
If we move the position upwards, the cutting points suddenly look a lot more viable, since there are more liberties.]
;AW[ed][eh][ei][gi]AB[dd][de][df][dg][dh][di][dj]AE[fc][fd][fe][ff][fg][fh][gd][ge][gf][gg]
C[Connections
Let's imagine Black tries to build territory on the left, White on the right.
There is a famous move available for Black to reduce White's area.
]
;B[gk]
C[Connections
This is called the monkey jump. It relies on the properties of the edge of the board.
We will not look at all of White's options here, but none can disconnect Black.
]
;W[ej]
C[Connections
This is one possible threat to separate.]
;B[ek]LB[dk:A][fk:B]
C[Connections
Now we have a situation like before, where any white stone played on a point that could separate Black would immediately be captured.
]
;AE[ej][ek]
C[Connections
Let's look at one other alternative for White.
]
;W[fj]
C[Connections
This move threatens to descend to the edge, which would separate the black stones.
]
;B[fk]
C[Connections
Black tries to connect up.]
;W[ek]
C[Connections
White tries to intercede.
]
;B[ej]
C[Connections
Black connects by capturing the one white stone - it cannot escape.
]
;W[hk]
C[Connections
This is how the sequence plays out.]
;B[dk]
C[Connections
This is how the sequence plays out.]
;W[gj]
C[Connections
This is how the sequence plays out.]
;B[ek]
C[Connections
This is how the sequence plays out.]
;W[hj]
C[Connections
This is how the sequence plays out.
Black has nicely reduced White's area.]
;AW[cj][di][ec][fc][fi]AB[fd][fe][ff][fg][fh][gb][gc][gh][gi][gj]AE[dd][de][df][dg][dh][dk][ek][gk][hj][hk]
C[Connections
Shortages of liberties can also affect connections along the edge.]
;B[]LB[ek:A][gk:B]
C[Connections
As we saw before, any stone White plays at A or B can be captured immediately.]MN[118]
;W[dk]
C[Connections
But if White plays here, the two black stones cannot escape.

]
;B[ek]
C[Connections
Connecting does not gain a liberty.
]
;W[gk]
C[Connections
Black should have given up the two stones to avoid this larger loss.
]
;AB[ck][dj][ej][fk]AE[dk][gk]TR[ck]
C[Connections
Going back, what happens if Black has one extra stone (marked with a triangle)?
]
;W[ek]
C[Connections
White can start with this throw-in.
]
;B[dk]
C[Connections
Let's assume Black tries to save everything.
]
;W[bk]
C[Connections
Now White gives atari from this side, and we see the same issue as before.
]
;B[ek]
C[Connections
Connecting does not help.
]
;W[gk]
C[Connections
Once again Black should have given up earlier to avoid this large loss.
